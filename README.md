# InCart

An e-commerce website built with **ReactJS** offers a fast, dynamic shopping experience using reusable components and efficient state management. It includes features like product listings, search, filters, product detail pages, a shopping cart, and user authentication. React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` manage data fetching and user interactions, often powered by APIs or backend services. Routing is handled with **React Router**, enabling smooth navigation between pages. Styled with CSS, Tailwind, or Material-UI, the site is responsive and mobile-friendly. Reactâ€™s virtual DOM ensures quick updates, making the platform scalable and user-centric for modern online shopping experiences.
